    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am working to go to college with a AICE degree studying sociology and psychology or maybe something to do with chemistry, I am working on this because I want to help my family with any future inconveniences.
    
I am working toward these set goals by studying and trying to achieve what I can do at school, I am also giving my all to succeed at a high level.

The values I need to consider the most is my health and well being along side the well being of those around me, my values despite my goals would not be ignored, a balance to everything.

I hope to have high level grades for the end of every year while also being recommended to high level courses to get more credits for college.

I want to be one of the first in my family to go to college and succeed in life while also being looked at with someone that has a proper title.</p>
